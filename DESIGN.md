## Brand & Style

**Inkwell** is the visual identity for Decol Writing Support, a desktop
workbench for writing essays, articles, and academic texts from a decolonial
and anti-colonial perspective, with an AI collaborator.

The metaphor is a writer's desk at night. Decolonial writing is document craft
done with care and weight — the UI should feel like a calm, well-lit desk, not a
monitoring dashboard. Warm charcoal tones stand in for dark paper, text is warm
ink rather than pure white, and the single ink-teal accent behaves like a
fountain pen: used sparingly, for exactly one important action at a time. The
emotional register is focused, trustworthy, and editorial — quiet confidence
instead of urgency.

The AI assistant is not a chat toy: it is a writing collaborator. Its output
renders as a serif **document bubble** — a surface well with a hairline border,
serif type in a readable column — so every reply is clearly containerized.
Machine-readouts (token estimates, timestamps) are set in monospace, like
instrument dials on the desk.

## Colors

The palette is warm throughout. Every neutral carries a faint brown undertone —
there is no cool gray, no blue-black, no pure white — so the app reads as
"paper and ink" rather than "tech dashboard". All tokens below are the dark
theme, which is the app's default; the light theme is a paper variant of the
same system (mapping at the end of this section).

- **Background (#14120f):** Warm charcoal paper. The entire app sits on this.
- **Surface (#1e1b17):** Cards and panels, one step lighter than the paper.
- **Surface-alt (#262219):** Input fields and nested wells inside surfaces.
- **Border (#3a352c):** Hairline definition between tonal layers.
- **Foreground (#f2ede4):** Warm ink for primary text.
- **Primary (#34d399):** The single accent — mint ink-teal, luminous enough to
  anchor dark paper. Reserved for the one primary action per screen, selected
  list items, focus rings, and the active tab pill. Text on it is deep
  tea-green (`on-primary` #0d2b22).
- **Secondary (#a8a094):** Warm stone for metadata, inactive pills, captions.
- **Muted (#8a8376):** Placeholders and helper text only.
- **Error (#f87171):** Soft vermilion for destructive actions and failures.

The app lets the user pick a personal accent from a preset palette or a colour
picker. Presets must live on the same warm family as `primary` (bright,
dark-friendly values); the custom picker is free-form but the app computes a
readable foreground automatically.

### Light theme (paper variant)

| Token | Value | Token | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| background | `#f7f4ef` | foreground | `#1f1b15` |
| surface | `#ffffff` | secondary | `#6b6357` |
| surface-alt | `#f1ede6` | muted | `#948c7e` |
| border | `#e3ddd2` | error | `#b91c1c` |
| primary | `#0f6e5c` | on-primary | `#ffffff` |

## Typography

Three voices, one purpose: UI chrome must stay quiet so the documents can speak.

- **Geist Sans** (variable) is the interface voice — headings, labels, body
  text, forms. Neutral and modern; used at 400/500/600 only.
- **Geist Mono** (variable) is the instrument voice — token estimates,
  timestamps, counts, anything that reports machine state. It signals "this is
  data, not prose".
- **Source Serif 4** (variable) is the document voice — every AI-written
  letter, draft, and review. In chat the assistant's output is set at 15px with
  a 1.6 line height inside a surface bubble (1px hairline border, 8px radius)
  capped at ~75ch, so replies read like compact, clearly separated letters on
  the desk.

Hierarchy: `headline-lg` for the company/tab titles, `headline-md` for section
titles, `headline-sm` for card titles, `body-lg`/`body-md` for running UI text,
`caption` for metadata, `label-md`/`label-sm` (500 weight) for buttons and
chips. Headings use tight tracking; body never does.

## Layout & Spacing

The app is a single desktop window (1200×800) with a single mode on a 4px
grid:

- **Write** (Writing Support): full-page document studio. Messages render in a
  centered column capped at 75ch (≈768px); the composer sits at the bottom
  with a live token readout in mono type. Conversations switch from a header
  dropdown; thread actions (new, delete, agent settings) are quiet icon
  buttons on the right.

Spacing is an 8px rhythm over a 4px unit: controls are 32px tall, inputs 36px,
card padding 20px, card gaps 16px, section margins 32px. The app is
information-dense on purpose — a desktop workbench — but never cramped: every
card keeps 20px of breathing room.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth is conveyed by **tonal layering**, not shadows: paper → surface cards →
surface-alt wells, each separated by a 1px `border`. Floating layers (dialogs,
select popovers, dropdowns) step up via a slightly lighter surface and a soft
shadow (`0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)` in dark, `0 4px 16px rgba(31,27,21,0.10)`
in light). Focus is a 2px ring in the primary hue with 50% opacity — never a
glow, never a blur. The active tab pill is flat primary, not a glowing bubble.

## Shapes

The shape language is **editorial**: slightly squared, with softness reserved
for things that should feel tactile. Controls (buttons, inputs, chips) use
8px; cards and dialogs use 12px; pills — status chips, the active tab pill,
the "Latest" jump button — are fully round. 6px exists only for micro
elements. Corners are never mixed within one element, and a 1px border
outlines every container.

## Components

### Buttons
Primary buttons are solid mint with deep tea-green text; hover steps one notch
brighter (`primary-hover`). Ghost and outline buttons are borderless/bordered
quiet text actions. Destructive buttons are solid vermilion with deep
vermilion-ink text. One primary action per screen, maximum.

### Cards
`surface` background, 1px border, 12px radius, 20px padding. Cards hold one
logical unit of data; related units sit 16px apart. Card titles use
`headline-sm`.

### Chat
User messages are compact primary bubbles (8px radius). Assistant messages are
**document bubbles**: surface background, 1px hairline border, serif type at
15px/1.6, capped at 75ch — one reply per bubble, so where a message starts and
ends is always clear. The action rail (regenerate, copy) sits beside each
assistant message as quiet icon buttons. A blinking cursor marks live
streaming.

### Inputs
36px fields on `surface-alt` with 1px borders; textareas share the treatment.
Placeholder text is muted. Focus shows the primary ring.

### List items
The thread dropdown in the header lists conversations transparently until
hover; the selected thread fills with a mint-tinted well (`selection`). Rows
expose a destructive affordance (trash) via the header, hover-only.

### Tab pill
The active tab is a full-round primary pill with on-primary text; inactive
tabs are transparent with secondary text, gaining a hover tint. Arrow-key
navigation moves between tabs.

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do use the primary accent for exactly one primary action per screen
- Do render AI output as serif document bubbles — surface well, hairline border, one reply per bubble
- Do keep machine readouts (tokens, timestamps) in Geist Mono
- Don't use cool grays or pure white/black — the palette is warm by contract
- Don't add shadows to cards — define layers with surfaces and 1px borders
- Don't use more than two UI weights (400/600, plus 500 for labels) per view
- Don't mix corner radii within a single element; pills are only for chips,
  the tab pill, and small jump buttons
- Do maintain WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 for normal text) against `background`
  and `surface` at all times
- Don't place the accent on large surfaces — it is an instrument, not a wall
